# Information-Retrieval-Projects
ECS736U/ECS736P - Information Retrieval - Projects Completed for this module are presented here. 

# Research Paper Presentation

The aim of this assignment is to read, discuss, and present a research paper in the Information Retrieval domain. You will work in a team of 3-4 students. A starting list of references is provided below for you to choose from. You can also expand your reading and choose a related, more recent research paper online.

# Search Engine Design

As part of your practical coursework, you are asked to build a search engine. You will work with the same group as in Assignment 1, unless for exceptional reasons, the group can be changed after discussion with and approval by the MO.

The aim of Assignments 2 and 3 is to fully understand how a search engine is built. For this purpose, you are asked to design and implement a search engine and evaluate it with experiments. You can make use of the platforms we introduce in the lab, or you can use any other existing tool. You may also want to build everything from scratch.

There are no restrictions in terms of tools, programming languages, and application/domains. A search engine interface is not compulsory, while you may want to consider interface components useful for your specific focus, like query recommendation, user feedback functions, etc.

## Assignment 2: Search Engine Design Report

In this assignment, you are expected to submit a 3 to 6-page report to describe the design of a search engine you would like to build. In the report, the following information can be included (but is not limited to):

1. **Aim, task, and dataset** - Describe a scenario that you will be investigating, such as a particular type of retrieval, using a particular type of documents, etc. Description of how models will be evaluated. (20%)
2. **General architecture** - A general architecture of the search engine, showing its components/modules, and how they relate to each other. (20%)
3. **Retrieval model(s)** - The retrieval model(s) you will be using. (20%)
4. **Tools** - The tool(s) you will be using to build the search engine. (20%)
5. **Teamwork** - Who in your group will be responsible for what. (10%)
6. **Time plan** - The time plan for the building of the search engine. (10%)

All the above need to be justified. The mark distribution can be considered as a general guideline. Your report should be submitted via QMPlus in PDF format.

## Assignment 3: Search Engine Presentation and Demo

The aim of Assignments 2 and 3 is to fully understand how a search engine is built by actually designing and implementing the search engine, and to present and demonstrate it to us. The expected outcome is a search system which allows entering a query (could be via a command line or GUI) and getting an output, i.e., a ranked list of documents. In the presentation, the following should be made clear:

- The indexing method you have used, and show some sample data
- The retrieval method you have used, and be able to explain the ranking you obtain
- Show how everything works on the document collection which has been provided
